# KMG

My wife (Ashley) and I developed KMG as a Christmas gift for my sister and brother-in-law (Mollie and Gus).
You can try it out on [itch.io](https://chunkilu.itch.io/kmg)!

KMG is a platformer made with [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) heavily inspired by [Celeste](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celeste_(video_game)). 
Ashley created the sprites and maps and I contributed the code, music and sfx. 
The gist of the game is that my sister's house cats have escaped and need
finding, but will only show themselves if lured out with snacks. You can play
as Mollie or Gus :)

## Development

I've always been inspired by Hackernews posts about the value of finishing
a game - though the concept of a "finished" game is subjective, picking a small
and well-defined enough scope, sticking to a deadline and actually releasing are indeed helpful motivators and quite satisfying.

Publishing our [first PICO-8 game on
itch.io](https://chunkilu.itch.io/frite-lite) gave us a sufficient confidence
boost to try and tackle a more complex game and Christmas provided a natural
deadline.
Seeing our incremental progress day by day over the course of the holiday
season eventually build into a playable game was incredibly motivating and we
met our target date comfortably.


While this codebase admittedly showcases a number of programming
antipatterns I normally pride myself on avoiding (magic numbers! duplication! super-long
functions! no tests! one file?!), this was by far the most rewarding personal project I've ever
worked on.
Collaborating with Ashley was a delight, the quality of her sprites and maps surpassed my wildest expectaions and we had a ton of fun bringing the concepts to life.
As an extra Christmas touch, we bought a [Powkiddy](https://powkiddy.com/) RGB-30 (cool!) so that Mol and Gus could play the game on a physical console.
While I would point to other personal projects for examples of perhaps more elegant software patterns, KMG will always have a special place in my heart as it brought the family together.

_It was a hit!_

### On Game Dev

If you're working in another industry (like web dev) and are interested in building games, go
for it! Chances are you'll get a chance to flex your data structures and
algorithms chops, find creative solutions to unique problems and have a blast
playing with something you made yourself. While there are several great game
engine options, I can't recommend PICO-8 enough: [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) is a delightfully
minimal programming language, the built-in sprite, map and music editors are
a ton of fun, the [community](https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?cat=7) is inspiring and helpful, plus the inherent limitations 
of the engine can help to keep the scope manageable. Give it a shot - best $15 I ever spent!
