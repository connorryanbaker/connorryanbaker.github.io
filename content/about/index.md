I'm Connor - software engineer and lifelong learner.

As a relative latecomer to the world of development, I enjoy learning more about how the tools we use everyday work "under the hood", as well as just about anything that makes reading and writing code fun.

I studied music at a conservatory before attending a [bootcamp](https://www.appacademy.io/) years later. After getting my first engineering job, I took a couple of excellent courses at the [Bradfield School of Computer Science](https://bradfieldcs.com/). I'm currently working at [codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) on the wonderful Content Platform team, primarily on GraphQL APIs.

Outside of programming, I enjoy running, soccer and spending time with my family, friends and grumpy little dog. I also [play drums](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K58JYXhb4YA&ab_channel=NPRMusic).
